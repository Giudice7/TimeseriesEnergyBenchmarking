    It evaluates your building‚Äôs performance by calculating a set of <strong>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</strong> and compares them to similar buildings (your peers) in the same Primary Space Usage (PSU) category, such as Office or Education buildings.</p>",

      "<p>The benchmarking process involves identifying your peer group based on features of your electric load ‚Äî including thermal sensitivity, load shape, and load conditions (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends, winter vs. summer).
    The KPIs are then converted into <strong>Performance Scores</strong> on a 0‚Äì100 scale, where higher scores indicate better performance.</p>",
